We also send you marketing messages, updates on your Membership, and information about your account, and as otherwise set forth herein.</p>
                <p class="pb-20">Information About Family Members. GoodRx allows you to add up to 6 total family members (including yourself) to your GoodRx Gold account. Family members may be added to your account or, if they are over 18, they can make their own accounts and connect them to your Membership. When you add family members, we ask for their first name, last name, and dates of birth. If a family member is under the age of 13, GoodRx does not request any additional contact information and children under 13 must not provide any information on or through our Services or through any of their features.</p>
                <p class="pb-20">Credit Card Information. A GoodRx Gold account is free for the first 30 days.
